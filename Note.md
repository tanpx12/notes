Smart contracts are self-executing agreements or program that run on a blockchain. They are coded with predefined rules and conditions, and their execution in automatically triggered when a certain conditions are met. Although the concept of "smart contract" have been around for quiet a while, but not until Ethereum, a public blockchain with a quasi-Turing-complete state machine, was released did smart contract starting to gain popularity among developer and researcher. Since then, the term "smart contract" has been widely known as a computer program deployed and runs on blockchain. Smart contracts are executed and validated by the participants of the blockchain network. Once deployed on the blockchain, they become part of the distributed ledger and are replicated across all participating nodes. This ensures transparency and prevent any individual or organization from having control or ability to manipulate the contract's execution. When predefined conditions are met, smart contracts automatically execute the specified actions without the need for human intervention. The blockchain should have a virtual machine to to be able to execute smart contract code. Some of the well-known virutal machine could be: Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), Filecoin Virtual Machine (FVM), ParaState SSVM, ... Within the scope of this thesis, "smart contract" only refer to the one on an EVM-compatible public blockchain, written in Solidity programming language.  

The EVM, which is responsible for deploying and executing smart contracts in the Ethereum network, plays a crucial role. In practical terms, basic value transfer transactions between externally owned accounts (EOAs) do not require the involvement of the EVM. However, any other operation or transaction will necessitate a state update calculation performed by the EVM. Conceptually, the EVM can be envisioned as a decentralized global computer within the Ethereum blockchain, comprising numerous executable entities, each possessing its own persistent data storage. 

The EVM employs a stack-based architecture, where all in-memory values are stored on a stack, utilizing a word size of 256 bits primarily for efficient native hashing and elliptic curve operations. It consists of several addressable data components, including a read-only program code ROM that holds the bytecode of the smart contract to be executed, a volatile memory with explicitly initialized zero values for each location, and a permanent storage component integrated into the Ethereum state, which is also zero-initialized and retains data across multiple contract executions. While the bytecode remains immutable after contract deployed, the storage can be changed with contract interaction call. These calls cost fee to execute, which depends on the complexity of the call and the amount of state change in the storage. The immutability of the bytecode provide security and trust to users of the Ethereum network, as they can verify that the deployed smart contract's code has not been tampered with or altered since its deployment. It also ensures that the execution of the smart contract follows the original intentions and rules defined in its initial deployment.
