| Idea                | Segment spaced into cells or sectors                  | Segments sending time into disjoint time slots demand driven or fixed partterns      | Segment the frequency band into disjoint subbands  | Spread the spectrum using orthogonal codes                                                             |
| Terminals           | Only one terminal can be active in one cell or sector | All terminals are active for short period of time on same frequency                  | Every terminal has its own frequency uninterrupted | All terminals can be active at the same place at the same moment uninterrupted                         |
| Signal sepration    | Cell structure, directed antenas                      | Synchronization in time domain                                                       | Filtering in the frequency domain                  | Code plus special receivers                                                                            |
| Transmission scheme | Continuous                                            | Discontinuous                                                                        | Continuous                                         | Continuous                                                                                             |
| Cell Capacity       | Depends on cell area                                  | Limited                                                                              | Limited                                            | No absolute limit on channel capacity but it is an interference limited system                         |
| Advantages          | Very simple,                                          | Established fully digital, flexible                                                  | Simple, established, robust                        | Flexible, less frequecy planning needed, soft handover                                                 |
| Disadvantages       | Inflexible, antenas typically fixed                   | Guard space needed, synchronization difficult                                        | Inflexible, frequencies are scarce resource        | Complex receivers, needs more complicated power control for senders                                    |
| Comment             | Only in combination with TDMA,FDMA or CDMA useful     | Standards in fixed networks, together with FDMA or SDMA used in many mobile networks | Typically combined wit TDMA and SDMA               | Still face some problems, higher complexity, lowered expectation, will be integrated with TDMA or FDMA |
